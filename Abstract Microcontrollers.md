Picture this: you are running late for your 8:30 AM senior design class.  It’s the middle of November in Houston. You look outside, and it’s a little overcast.  You’ve just started seeing a guy in your class, and you want to look good.  Even though it is overcast outside, you know that it might not actually be cold (thanks Houston).  You’re running out of time. So what do you do? 

We are going to create an app that allows users to find the best outfit to wear for the day. The app will take a picture of the user and use facial recognition to obtain the user’s skin tone.  The app will also check the weather for the day. Using the skin tone of the user and the weather for the day, the app can find the best outfit for the user to wear.  

The idea came from watching the movie, Clueless.  In the movie, the main character finds an outfit to wear on the computer by clicking through outfits she has and selecting one. The computer then prints what the outfit will look like on her.  [Click here for the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU)
